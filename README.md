# AUBG-Gaming
This is a senior project for my Computer Science major. The projects is a web-application for a video game store that offers video games, some hardware, and services. Other than an account system, cart, and basic operations such as viewing, adding products to cart, and ordering, there is a custom search algorithm utilizing the Google Maps API to find the shortest path between 2 cities in Bulgaria. The projects was relized with Go and many CI/CD technologies such as Docker and Kubernetese. The application was hosted on a Kubernetes cluster on the Google Cloud Platform.
